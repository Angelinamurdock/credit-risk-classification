# Credit Risk Analysis Report
**Creator**: Angelina Murdock  
**Date**: May 2025

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to train and evaluate a machine learning model that can predict loan risk and assess the creditworthiness of borrowers.
The dataset consisted of historical financial data from a peer-to-peer lending platform. The target variable, `loan_status`, indicated whether a loan was considered high risk (1) or healthy (0). The dataset was imbalanced, with significantly more healthy loans than high-risk loans.
The machine learning process involved preprocessing the data, splitting it into training and testing sets, training a `LogisticRegression` model, and evaluating its performance using a **confusion matrix** and **classification report**.

## Results
**Logistic Regression:**
- Accuracy: 0.99 
- Precision (Healthy): 1.00
- Recall (Healthy): 1.00
- Precision (High-Risk): 0.87
- Recall (High-Risk): 0.95

## Summary
The Logistic Regression model performed exceptionally well on the imbalanced dataset. It achieved **99% accuracy**, with a **precision of 0.87** and **recall of 0.95** for high-risk loans. The confusion matrix shows that the model correctly identified 593 high-risk loans, while misclassifying only 32 as low risk. This demonstrates a strong ability to detect borrowers who pose a higher default risk. However, there were still some false negatives and false positives.
The **classification report** supports these findings, with an **F1-score of 0.91** for the high-risk class and nearly perfect scores for the healthy class. Despite the class imbalance, the model maintained balanced performance, making it suitable for real-world credit risk assessment.

### **Recommendation:**
The model performs well in identifying high-risk loans, making it a strong choice for the companyâ€™s credit risk strategy. It effectively balances overall accuracy with the ability to detect risky borrowers. To maintain its reliability, ongoing monitoring and periodic updates with new data are recommended.
